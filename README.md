How long did you spend on this assignment?
This implementation took me about 4 hours to complete.
Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?
Considering the time and thought I put into this, I'd say I earned an A for effort.
Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?
The solution is functional and well-structured, so I believe I earned an A-.
Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.
The solution works correctly, but it uses extra memory in the display function by creating a full matrix. I attempted to optimize this by directly printing from the elements vector but struggled with maintaining the correct order of elements. A possible improvement could be implementing a more memory-efficient display method.
